After establishing a corpus of relevant documents to cyberbullying detection, we analyzed the human involvement in the development of these models using an established human-centered algorithmic design framework [13]. Specifically, we reviewed the past research in terms of their considerations for theoretical, participatory, and speculative design. Our review revealed that despite extensive research on developing cyberbullying detection models that optimize for statistical performance and methodological innovation, there were clear gaps in terms of a) how the complex phenomenon of cyberbullying was defined and operationalized from a theoreticalgrounding perspective; b) how a lack of involvement of stakeholders of bullying in data curation exposed potential for construct validity issues; and c) how poor speculation of the uses and users of the algorithms not only hampered model evaluation in real-world scenarios, but opened up opportunities for harm to various participating actors of cyberbullying. We concluded with guidelines on how a human-centered approach can help to address these pervasive concerns in this important research area within social computing.”</span></a></span> <span class="citation" data-citation="%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fusers%2F8071752%2Fitems%2F4MAGKTIY%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%223276%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D" ztype="zcitation">(<span class="citation-item"><a href="zotero://select/library/items/4MAGKTIY">Kim 等, 2021, p. 3276</a></span>)</span> 在本文中，我们对过去关于自动网络欺凌检测模型的文献进行了系统回顾。在建立了网络欺凌检测相关文档的语料库之后，我们使用已建立的以人为中心的算法设计框架 \[13] 分析了人类参与这些模型开发的情况。具体来说，我们回顾了过去的研究，从他们对理论、参与和思辨设计的考虑来看。我们的审查表明，尽管对开发针对统计性能和方法创新进行优化的网络欺凌检测模型进行了广泛的研究，但在以下方面存在明显差距：a）如何从理论基础的角度定义和实施网络欺凌的复杂现象； b) 欺凌利益相关者在数据管理中缺乏参与如何暴露出结构有效性问题的可能性； c) 对算法的用途和用户的推测不当不仅阻碍了现实场景中的模型评估，而且还为网络欺凌的各种参与者带来了伤害的机会。我们总结了关于以人为本的方法如何帮助解决社会计算这一重要研究领域中普遍存在的问题的指导方针。
